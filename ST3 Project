          we can change as many protery as we want and as much as we want
    ==>TO use use css we first need to specify some keyframes for animantion
    .the keyframes hold what style the element will have at certain time
    ==> KEYFRAME RULE:
     to apply css in keyframe which will gradually change from one style to another after certain amount of time
     we nedd to bind the animantion to the elment we do
     -by defining the keyframe an then applying it to the elment as
     //the animation code:         //binding it to the elemnet
      @keyframe example{          .div{ width:10px;
      from{colo:red}                    hieght:20px;
      to{color:white}                  animation-name:example;
      }                                animation-time:2 sec;}


      --animation-delay:delay for start of animatoion//if negative value is given the animation will start as if had been playing already
      --animation-iteration-count:no of time animation should run
      --animation direction:wherther animation sholud be played forward or backward or in alternate cycles
